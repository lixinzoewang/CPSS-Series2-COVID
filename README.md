The Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact Canadians in various facets. These changes and impacts can link to people’s adverse mental health conditions. This study uses a large-scale data from Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) Series 2- Monitoring the Effects of COVID-19. 

Our goal is to focus on the relationship between mental health conditions and financial stress, food insecurity, and internet usage. Spearman’s rank correlation, OLS regression and ordered logit regression have been used in this study. Model comparisons and model evaluations are carried out after building models for each hypothesis. We show that ordered logit regression is the most appropriate method to model our dataset. All of our hypothesizes are accepted. The model for the last hypothesis (H4) has the best performance. 

One of our main findings is that the severity of generalized anxiety is related to the increased effect of financial obligation, internet usage, and food insecurity.
